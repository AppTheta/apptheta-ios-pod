PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY; THIS IS A BINDING CONTRACT.

These Scriber API Terms of Use ("API Terms") set out the terms and conditions of use of the Scriber
Web or Mobile APIs (individually known as "API" or collectively as "APIs"). If you want to use the
Scriber APIs, you must first register with Scriber (the "Registration") by completing the
information on the Scriber registration form available at http://scriber.io/signup/ (the "Scriber
Website"). By submitting your Registration to Scriber and / or using the Scriber API, you agree to
these API Terms. Scriber may amend these API Terms at any time by posting the amended API Terms on the
Scriber Website, and you agree that you will be bound by any changes to these API Terms. For your
convenience, the date of last revision is included at the top of this page. Scriber reserves the
right, at its sole discretion, to refuse or reject your Registration at any time.

You and Scriber agree as follows:

1. License. The Scriber APIs are owned by Scriber, and are licensed to you on a non-exclusive,
non-sublicenseable basis on the terms and conditions set forth herein. These terms define legal use of
the Scriber APIs, all updates, revisions, substitutions, and any copies of the Scriber APIs made by

Terms.

5. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Scriber API will be at your own risk and account.
You agree, on demand, to indemnify, defend and hold Scriber, its affiliates and staff harmless from

(b) any breach or violation of the terms and conditions of these API Terms and any other applicable
additional terms and (c) the provision by you of any Software Application you develop
using the Scriber API.

6. Scriber reserves the right to modify these API Terms at any time, on a general or individual
basis, by publishing the revised API Terms on the Scriber Website or by otherwise notifying you of the
revised API Terms. Your continued use of the Scriber API shall constitute your acceptance to be bound
by the terms and conditions of the revised API Terms.

remedies, Scriber may limit, suspend or terminate these API Terms (and any other additional terms) and
your use of the Scriber API at any time if we think that you are in breach of these API Terms or if we
think that you have acted in a way which shows that you do not intend to comply with these API Terms. In
addition, Scriber may terminate these API Terms with immediate effect at any time, for any reason,
including but not limited to, if you engage in any action that in Scriber's sole discretion devalues
Scriber's brand or reputation, the Scriber Library or the Scriber API.

8. Support. Scriber may elect to provide you with support or modifications for the API or Scriber
Ship Library (collectively, "Support"), in its sole discretion, and may terminate such Support at any
time without notice to you. Scriber may change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Scriber
API, or the Scriber Library at any time, including the availability of the Scriber API or the
Scriber Library. Scriber may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict
your access to parts or all of the Scriber API, the Scriber Library or the Scriber Web site
without notice or liability.

9. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability:

(a) No Warranties: THE SCRIBER API IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER; SCRIBER DOES
NOT, EITHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, CLAIMS OR REPRESENTATIONS WITH RESPECT
TO THE SCRIBER API, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR USE FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SCRIBER FURTHER DOES
NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SCRIBER API WILL ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE, ACCESSIBLE, UNINTERRUPTED,
TIMELY, SECURE, ACCURATE, COMPLETE AND ERROR-FREE OR WILL OPERATE WITHOUT DATA LOSS.

(b) No Liability: THE SCRIBER API IS BEING PROVIDED TO YOU FREE OF CHARGE. ACCORDINGLY, YOU
ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SCRIBER, ITS AFFILIATES, ITS LICENSORS AND THE SCRIBER STAFF WILL HAVE NO
LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SCRIBER API, AS SET FORTH BELOW. YOUR
ONLY RIGHT OR REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY PROBLEMS OR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SCRIBER API IS TO
IMMEDIATELY CEASE USE OF SUCH SCRIBER API.

STAFF BE LIABLE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY
OTHER FORM OF LIABILITY, FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING

SCRIBER, ITS AFFILIATES OR THE SCRIBER STAFF HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR
DAMAGES ARISING.

(e) NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO EXCLUDE OR RESTRICT OR SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS EXCLUDING OR
RESTRICTING THE LIABILITY OF SCRIBER FOR (I) THE DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF
SCRIBER, THE SCRIBER STAFF OR ITS AGENTS, OR (II) ANY LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT BE LIMITED OR EXCLUDED
BY LAW. As some jurisdictions do not allow some of the exclusions or limitations as set forth above,
some of these exclusions or limitations may not apply to you. In such event the liability will be
limited to the maximum extent possible within the applicable legislation.

15. Release and Waiver. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby release and waive
all claims against Scriber, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, licensors, co-branders
or other partners, and employees from any and all liability for claims, damages (actual and/or
consequential), costs and expenses (including litigation costs and attorneys' fees) of every kind and
nature, arising from or in any way related to your use of Scriber APIs. If you are a California
resident, you waive your rights under California Civil Code Â¤ 1542, which states, "A general release
does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time
of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the
debtor." You understand that any fact relating to any matter covered by this release may be found to be
other than now believed to be true and you accept and assume the risk of such possible differences in
fact. In addition, you expressly waive and relinquish any and all rights and benefits which you may have
under any other state or federal statute or common law principle of similar effect, to the fullest
extent permitted by law.

16. General:

(a) API Terms Revisions. These API Terms may only be revised in a writing signed by Scriber, or
published by Scriber on the Sites.

(b) No Partnership. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship
exists between you and Scriber as a result of these API Terms.

(c) Assignment. Scriber may assign these API Terms, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at
any time with or without your consent. You may not assign the API Terms without Scriber's prior
written consent, and any unauthorized assignment by you shall be null and void.

(d) Severability. If any part of these API Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, then that
portion shall be severed, and the remainder of the API Terms shall be given full force and effect.

(e) Attorneys' Fees. In the event any litigation is brought by either party in connection with these API
Terms, the prevailing party in such litigation shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the
reasonable costs, attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the
litigation.

(f) No Waiver. Our failure to enforce any provision of these API Terms shall in no way be construed to
be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce
each and every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by us of any provision, condition or
requirement of these API Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with
such provision, condition or requirement.

(g) Notices. All notices given by you or required under these API Terms shall be in writing and
addressed to: Scriber, Inc., 2913 Acton St. Berkeley, CA 94702, ATTN: CEO.

(i) Equitable Remedies. You hereby agree that Scriber would be irreparably damaged if the terms of
these API Terms were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that we shall be entitled,
without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to
breaches of these API Terms, in addition to such other remedies as we may otherwise have available to us
under applicable laws.

(j) Entire Agreement. These API Terms, including the documents expressly incorporated by reference,
constitutes the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Sites and/or Service and
